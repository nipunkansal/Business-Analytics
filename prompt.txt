"I have the following tabular data:

Column 1	Column 2	Column 3
Value 1	Value 2	Value 3
Value A	Value B	Value C
Please convert this into a human-readable summary. Each row should be described in a complete sentence or concise paragraph. Ensure the text is clear, informative, and easy to understand. Use the column headers to provide context for each value. Here's an example structure for your output:

In the first row, [Column 1] is [Value 1], [Column 2] is [Value 2], and [Column 3] is [Value 3].
In the second row, [Column 1] is [Value A], [Column 2] is [Value B], and [Column 3] is [Value C].
Ensure the summary sounds natural and avoids repetition."
