Clarity: Present the information in a way that is easy to understand for a general audience.
Completeness: Include every detail from the table without omitting any data points.
Structure: Organize the content logically, grouping related information together.
Intent: Accurately convey the purpose of the data, ensuring no misinterpretation of its meaning.
